# Case: <session-id>

Workspace: ~/.superpowers/diagnosing-superpowers/<session-id>/
Created: <ISO timestamp>

## Problem statement (agreed with your human partner)

<One paragraph. Names the session(s), the turn range if known, what was
expected, what happened, and the observable that matters: wall-clock,
tokens, repeated actions, a specific unexpected action.>

Goal is a superpowers bug report: yes | no

## Sessions

| Role | Session id | Absolute path | Lines | Bytes | Longest line (bytes) | First prompt (first 120 chars) | First timestamp |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| main | | | | | | | |
| subagent | | | | | | | |

Rejected candidates: <id — path — why rejected>, or "none".

Session still running at read time: yes | no (mtime <ISO>, lines <N>)

## Environment

- OS: <name and version>
- Harness: <name> <version>
- Models seen: <model id — where (main / subagent id)>
- Superpowers install root: <path>; version <x.y.z>; git sha <sha or "not a checkout">
- Skill files read or injected during the session:

| Skill / source path | sha1 or unavailable | Provenance | Supporting location |
|---|---|---|---|

Label environment and skill observations as historical evidence, unverified
snapshot, current observation, or unknown. Check supplied provenance notes,
archives and captured skill bodies before declaring historical information
unavailable. Missing original paths do not erase retained copies. Current
versions/mtimes do not establish historical versions; one captured skill body
does not authenticate an entire installation.

- Other plugins / extensions / MCP servers configured: <list, or "none found">
- Instruction files present (paths only): <list>

## Context-safety rules for every reader of these files

- Follow `references/context-safety.md` before reading any file listed here.
- In a subagent transcript, "user" is the parent agent.

## Discovered sources and record meanings

- Sources consulted: <absolute path, tool, help, or documentation source>
- Extraction commands or queries: <bounded commands or tool queries used for each source>
- Target identity evidence: <session id, working directory, timestamps, matching content, and supporting record locations>
- Associated sessions: <session id, relationship, and supporting record locations, or "none found">
- Human messages: <record shape and evidence for its meaning>
- Injected messages and parent dispatches: <record shape and evidence for its meaning>
- Assistant messages: <record shape and evidence for its meaning>
- Tool calls and results: <record shapes, how they match, and evidence for those meanings>
- Usage counters: <fields, incremental or cumulative semantics, units, and evidence, or "unavailable">
- Timing: <fields, units, event boundaries, and evidence, or "unavailable">
- Other relevant records: <models, versions, compactions, or other meanings and evidence>
- Unresolved information: <missing, inaccessible, ambiguous, or absent information, or "none">
