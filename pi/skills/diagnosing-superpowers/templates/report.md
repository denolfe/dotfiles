# Session diagnosis: <session-id>

Report path: ~/.superpowers/diagnosing-superpowers/<session-id>/report.md
Written: <ISO timestamp>

## 1. Problem statement (REQUIRED)

<Copied from the case file.>

## 2. Triage verdict (REQUIRED)

<What the evidence shows happened around the reported problem. Prose, with
`path:line` after every claim. State confidence: high / medium / low, and
what would raise it. No statement about what superpowers should do.>

## 3. Environment (REQUIRED)

- OS:
- Harness and version:
- Models seen:
- Superpowers install root / version / git sha:
- Skill files read or injected (sha1 table from the case file):
- Other plugins, extensions, MCP servers:
- Instruction files present (paths only):

Label every environment field and skill observation as historical evidence,
unverified snapshot, current observation, or unknown, and record its
supporting evidence location.

## 4. Sessions examined (REQUIRED)

| Role | Session id | Absolute path | Lines | Bytes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Rejected candidates: <id — path — why>, or "none".

## 5. Timeline (REQUIRED)

One row per human-typed prompt. Events column lists skills invoked,
subagents dispatched, compaction, errors, resumes, aborts.

| Turn | Line | Time | Request (one line) | Events |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 6. Findings (REQUIRED, one subsection per dimension)

Each finding:
```
- finding: <one sentence>
  evidence: <path:line> — "<short quote>"
  turns: <first>–<last>

```
A dimension with nothing to report says `none found — checked: <what was checked>`.
