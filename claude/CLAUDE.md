Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Coding Patterns and Best Practices (Typescript)

- Prefer single object parameters (improves backwards-compatibility)
- Prefer types over interfaces (except when extending external types)
- Prefer functions over classes (classes only for errors/adapters)
- Prefer pure functions; when mutation is unavoidable, return the mutated object instead of void.
- Organize functions top-down: exports before helpers
- Use JSDoc for complex functions; add tags only when justified beyond type signature
- Use `import type` for types, regular `import` for values, separate statements even from same module
- Prefix booleans with `is`/`has`/`can`/`should` (e.g., `isValid`, `hasData`) for clarity
- Commenting Guidelines
  - Execution flow: Skip comments when code is self-documenting. Keep for complex logic, non-obvious "why", multi-line context, or if following a documented, multi-step flow.
  - Top of file/module: Use sparingly; only for non-obvious purpose/context or an overview of complex logic.
  - Type definitions: Property/interface documentation is always acceptable.
